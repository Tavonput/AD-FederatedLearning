Abstract the async servers by making one async server class, then create an AsyncTrainer and a TraditionalTrainer.

Track the model parameter distribution and delta distribution over time. My hypothesis is that the delta distribution
will be smaller and more closely compacted around zero. Also maybe track the quantization error (this will hinder 
performance as need to do some additional communication and computation, but this will be just a study on error, not
performance)?

Better visuals for accuracy and loss.
